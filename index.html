              If you receive a bid, a group of PSE members will deliver it to your dorm, house, etc. Once all of the bids are handed out, there will be a casual event where you can meet active members and the other new members in your class. If you do not receive a bid from PSE, you will hear from our Director of Recruitment with the next steps. You are always welcome to connect with him/her for feedback or questions.

            <p class="cd-h-timeline__event-description color-contrast-medium"> 
              The New Member Project is an immersive experience designed to introduce new members to the core values and real-world applications of Pi Sigma Epsilon. Each year, the project varies in scope, but the structure remains the same—new members are placed in teams of 4-5, led by an experienced member acting as a mentor. Together, they conduct research and develop strategic solutions for a real client, with past partnerships including BIBIBOP Asian Grill, LionsGate, and Procter & Gamble. The project is structured to be manageable alongside coursework, with flexibility to accommodate students’ schedules. Support is always available through team leads, new member educators, and older chapter members, ensuring a rewarding and educational experience.            </p>
